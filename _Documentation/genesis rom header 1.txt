ROM header
The ROM header starts at $000100 and contains information about the cartridge. The following assembly code shows how to declare the header:
1:              dc.b "SEGA GENESIS    "
2:              dc.b "(C)SEGA 1992.SEP"
3:              dc.b "YOUR GAME HERE                                  "
4:              dc.b "YOUR GAME HERE                                  "
5:              dc.b "GM XXXXXXXX-XX"
6:              dc.w $D951
7:              dc.b "J               "
8:              dc.l 0
9:              dc.l ROM_End
10:             dc.l $FF0000
11:             dc.l $FFFFFF
12:             dc.b "    "
13:             dc.b "    "
14:             dc.b "    "
15:             dc.b "            "
16:             dc.b "                                        "
17:             dc.b "JUE             "
The name of the console. Should be either "SEGA GENESIS" or "SEGA MEGA DRIVE". Must be 16 characters long.
Firm name and build date. Must be 16 characters long, firm name is four characters long.
Domestic name. Must be 48 characters long.
International name. Must be 48 characters long.
Program type and serial number. First two characters are either "GM" (game) or "AL" (educational). After the space, a series of eight digits gives the serial number. The final two digits give the version number.
Checksum.
I/O device support. You can probably ignore this.
Start of the ROM. This should always be 0.
End of the ROM. It's best to use a label at the end of your source file to determine this.
Start of RAM. Just about every game starts at $FF0000, but RAM is mirrored at several other places, and you can use those if you want.
End of RAM. Should be $FFFF after the starting point.
Backup RAM ID. Fill this with spaces if there is none, otherwise, use this formula:
dc.b "RA",%1x1yy000,%0010000
where x is true when the RAM is for backup and false if not. (I've no idea what the difference is.) yy is 11 if addressing is odd bytes only, 10 if even only, and 00 if both.
Start address of backup RAM. Fill with spaces if there is no backup RAM.
End address of backup RAM.
Modem support. Fill with spaces if there is no modem, otherwise follow this formula:
"MOxxxxyy.zzz"
where xxxx is the firm name, yy is the modem number, and zzz is the version number.
Notes. Put whatever you want here, and fill the empty spaces with zeroes.
Country codes. J is for Japan, U is for the United States, and E is for Europe. You need to fill in the rest of this field with spaces.
